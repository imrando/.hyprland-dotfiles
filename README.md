## Disclaimer!
These dots are meant to be used on an arch based distro or arch itself, and I have yet to test these dots on other distros, 
So be careful if you are using it on another distro as the repos may not have the things you need to make this rice complete!

# Installation
Just copy down the repo with
'git clone https://github.com/imrando/.hyprland-dotfiles'

and copy the dots either by hand or via the command line by using

'cp -r .hyprland-dotfiles/* $HOME/.config/'
